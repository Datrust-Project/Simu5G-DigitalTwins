This example consists of one real UE and one real server, connected via a simulated
network including one gNB, one UPF, one natRouter and one router.

To run this example, you have to run the external applications:

- For the client application use, e.g., "Iperf" with following command line:
  	iperf -c 10.0.2.1 -P 1 -i 1 -m -p 10021 -M 536.0B -l 2.0M -f m -t 0
- For the server application use, e.g., "Iperf" with the following command line:
  	iperf -s -P 1 -i 1 -p 10021

IP addresses and routing tables are set up by using mrt files (see "routing" folder).
 
*** NOTE ***
In order to run an emulation where both the endpoints of a connection are real applications,
the client application (e.g. on the UE) needs to use the IP address of the natRouter within the
simulation as destination address. Such natRouter element will perform Network Address 
Translation (NAT), according to the rules specified with the corresponding parameter in the 
INI file. 
In the example included in this folder. the client IP address is 10.0.0.1, while the server
IP address is 10.0.3.1. The NAT rules on the simulated router are set as:
   
    *.natRouter.ipv4.natTable.config = xml("<config> \
                                            <entry type='prerouting' \
                                            packetDataFilter='*Ipv4Header and destAddress=~10.0.2.1' \
                                            srcAddress='10.0.3.2' destAddress='10.0.3.1'/> \
                                            <entry type='prerouting' \
                                            packetDataFilter='*Ipv4Header and destAddress=~10.0.3.2' \
                                            srcAddress='10.0.2.1' destAddress='10.0.0.1'/> \
                                        </config>")
 
 
 
=== HOW TO BUILD AND RUN ===

1) Make sure that the emulation feature is enabled in the INET project:

- via the IDE: right-click on the 'inet' folder in the Project Explorer -> Properties;
               select OMNeT++ -> Project Features; 
               tick the box "Network emulation support".
- via the command line: in the root INET folder, type 'opp_featuretool enable NetworkEmulationSupport'.

  If the feature was disabled, recompile INET with the command 'make' (in the root INET folder).  


2) In order to be able to send/receive packets through sockets, set the application permissions: 

    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run
    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run_dbg
    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run_release


3) Compile Simu5G from the command line by running (in the root Simu5G folder):
    $ . setenv
	$ make makefiles
	$ make 
	 	
	 	
4) Run the simulation by launching the script ./run.sh
